  <h1>Interfaces</h1>
  <ul>
    
      <li>xdg_wm_base -- create desktop-style surfaces -- 
      The xdg_wm_base interface is exposed as a global object enabling clients
      to turn their wl_surfaces into windows in a desktop environment. It
      defines the basic functionality needed for clients and the compositor to
      create windows that can be dragged, resized, maximized, etc, as well as
      creating transient windows such as popup menus.
    </li>
    
      <li>xdg_positioner -- child surface positioner -- 
      The xdg_positioner provides a collection of rules for the placement of a
      child surface relative to a parent surface. Rules can be defined to ensure
      the child surface remains within the visible area&#x27;s borders, and to
      specify how the child surface changes its position, such as sliding along
      an axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-created rules are
      constrained by the requirement that a child surface must intersect with or
      be at least partially adjacent to its parent surface.

      See the various requests for details about possible rules.

      At the time of the request, the compositor makes a copy of the rules
      specified by the xdg_positioner. Thus, after the request is complete the
      xdg_positioner object can be destroyed or reused; further changes to the
      object will have no effect on previous usages.

      For an xdg_positioner object to be considered complete, it must have a
      non-zero size set by set_size, and a non-zero anchor rectangle set by
      set_anchor_rect. Passing an incomplete xdg_positioner object when
      positioning a surface raises an error.
    </li>
    
      <li>xdg_surface -- desktop user interface surface base interface -- 
      An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for
      implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.

      It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user
      interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as
      toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into
      xdg_surface roles.

      Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order
      to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object
      using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given
      xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
      not based on xdg_surface.

      A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the
      xdg_surface object.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the xdg_surface state to take effect.

      Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
      committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
      manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
      also be treated as errors.

      Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it
      possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that
      a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.

      For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following
      conditions must be met:
      (1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface
      (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the
	  role-dependent state to the surface
      (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface

      A newly-unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out
      of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface
      has not been destroyed.
    </li>
    
      <li>xdg_toplevel -- toplevel surface -- 
      This interface defines an xdg_surface role which allows a surface to,
      among other things, set window-like properties such as maximize,
      fullscreen, and minimize, set application-specific metadata like title and
      id, and well as trigger user interactive operations such as interactive
      resize and move.

      Unmapping an xdg_toplevel means that the surface cannot be shown
      by the compositor until it is explicitly mapped again.
      All active operations (e.g., move, resize) are canceled and all
      attributes (e.g. title, state, stacking, ...) are discarded for
      an xdg_toplevel surface when it is unmapped.

      Attaching a null buffer to a toplevel unmaps the surface.
    </li>
    
      <li>xdg_popup -- short-lived, popup surfaces for menus -- 
      A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface. It can be used to
      implement for example menus, popovers, tooltips and other similar user
      interface concepts.

      A popup can be made to take an explicit grab. See xdg_popup.grab for
      details.

      When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at
      the same time the surface will be unmapped. See the xdg_popup.popup_done
      event for details.

      Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup and
      unmap the surface. Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another
      surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
      request.

      A newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created
      xdg_popup surfaces associated with the same xdg_toplevel.

      The parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface
      description) before the xdg_popup itself.

      The x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify
      where the top left of the popup should be placed, relative to the
      local surface coordinates of the parent surface. See
      xdg_surface.get_popup. An xdg_popup must intersect with or be at least
      partially adjacent to its parent surface.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the xdg_popup state to take effect.
