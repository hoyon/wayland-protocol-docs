        <div class="f6 lh-copy ws-pre-line courier">The xdg_positioner provides a collection of rules for the placement of a
child surface relative to a parent surface. Rules can be defined to ensure
the child surface remains within the visible area&#x27;s borders, and to
specify how the child surface changes its position, such as sliding along
an axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-created rules are
constrained by the requirement that a child surface must intersect with or
be at least partially adjacent to its parent surface.

See the various requests for details about possible rules.

At the time of the request, the compositor makes a copy of the rules
specified by the xdg_positioner. Thus, after the request is complete the
xdg_positioner object can be destroyed or reused; further changes to the
object will have no effect on previous usages.

For an xdg_positioner object to be considered complete, it must have a
non-zero size set by set_size, and a non-zero anchor rectangle set by
set_anchor_rect. Passing an incomplete xdg_positioner object when
positioning a surface raises an error.

implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.

It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user
interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as
toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into
xdg_surface roles.

Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order
to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object
using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given
xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
not based on xdg_surface.

A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the
xdg_surface object.

The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
for the xdg_surface state to take effect.

Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
also be treated as errors.

Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it
possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that
a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.

For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following
conditions must be met:
(1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface
(2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the
role-dependent state to the surface
(3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface

A newly-unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out
of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface
has not been destroyed.

portions like drop-shadows which should be ignored for the
purposes of aligning, placing and constraining windows.

The window geometry is double buffered, and will be applied at the
time wl_surface.commit of the corresponding wl_surface is called.

When maintaining a position, the compositor should treat the (x, y)
coordinate of the window geometry as the top left corner of the window.
A client changing the (x, y) window geometry coordinate should in
general not alter the position of the window.

Once the window geometry of the surface is set, it is not possible to
unset it, and it will remain the same until set_window_geometry is
called again, even if a new subsurface or buffer is attached.

If never set, the value is the full bounds of the surface,
including any subsurfaces. This updates dynamically on every
commit. This unset is meant for extremely simple clients.

The arguments are given in the surface-local coordinate space of
the wl_surface associated with this xdg_surface.

The width and height must be greater than zero. Setting an invalid size
will raise an error. When applied, the effective window geometry will be
the set window geometry clamped to the bounding rectangle of the
combined geometry of the surface of the xdg_surface and the associated
subsurfaces.

For instance, for toplevel surfaces the compositor might use this
information to move a surface to the top left only when the client has
drawn itself for the maximized or fullscreen state.

If the client receives multiple configure events before it
can respond to one, it only has to ack the last configure event.

A client is not required to commit immediately after sending
an ack_configure request - it may even ack_configure several times
before its next surface commit.

A client may send multiple ack_configure requests before committing, but
only the last request sent before a commit indicates which configure
event the client really is responding to.

the surface (e.g. fullscreen or maximized).

If triggered, the client will receive configure events with the
&quot;resize&quot; state enum value and the expected sizes. See the &quot;resize&quot;
enum value for more details about what is required. The client
must also acknowledge configure events using &quot;ack_configure&quot;. After
the resize is completed, the client will receive another &quot;configure&quot;
event without the resize state.

If triggered, the surface also will lose the focus of the device
(wl_pointer, wl_touch, etc) used for the resize. It is up to the
compositor to visually indicate that the resize is taking place,
such as updating a pointer cursor, during the resize. There is no
guarantee that the device focus will return when the resize is
completed.

The edges parameter specifies how the surface should be resized,
and is one of the values of the resize_edge enum. The compositor
may use this information to update the surface position for
example when dragging the top left corner. The compositor may also
use this information to adapt its behavior, e.g. choose an
appropriate cursor image.

The client can specify a maximum size so that the compositor does

The width and height arguments are in window geometry coordinates.

The compositor can use this information to allow or disallow

The client should not rely on the compositor to obey the maximum
size. The compositor may decide to ignore the values set by the
client and request a larger size.

If never set, or a value of zero in the request, means that the
client has no expected maximum size in the given dimension.
As a result, a client wishing to reset the maximum size
to an unspecified state can use zero for width and height in the

After requesting that the surface should be maximized, the compositor
will respond by emitting a configure event. Whether this configure
actually sets the window maximized is subject to compositor policies.
The client must then update its content, drawing in the configured
state. The client must also acknowledge the configure when committing
the new content (see ack_configure).

It is up to the compositor to decide how and where to maximize the
surface, for example which output and what region of the screen should
be used.

If the surface was already maximized, the compositor will still emit
a configure event with the &quot;maximized&quot; state.

After requesting that the surface should be unmaximized, the compositor

un-maximizes the window is subject to compositor policies.
If available and applicable, the compositor will include the window
geometry dimensions the window had prior to being maximized in the
configure event. The client must then update its content, drawing it in
the configured state. The client must also acknowledge the configure
when committing the new content (see ack_configure).

It is up to the compositor to position the surface after it was
unmaximized; usually the position the surface had before maximizing, if
applicable.

If the surface was already not maximized, the compositor will still
emit a configure event without the &quot;maximized&quot; state.

After requesting that the surface should be fullscreened, the
compositor will respond by emitting a configure event. Whether the
client is actually put into a fullscreen state is subject to compositor
policies. The client must also acknowledge the configure when
committing the new content (see ack_configure).

The output passed by the request indicates the client&#x27;s preference as
to which display it should be set fullscreen on. If this value is NULL,
it&#x27;s up to the compositor to choose which display will be used to map
this surface.

If the surface doesn&#x27;t cover the whole output, the compositor will
position the surface in the center of the output and compensate with
with border fill covering the rest of the output. The content of the
border fill is undefined, but should be assumed to be in some way that
attempts to blend into the surrounding area (e.g. solid black).

If the fullscreened surface is not opaque, the compositor must make
sure that other screen content not part of the same surface tree (made
up of subsurfaces, popups or similarly coupled surfaces) are not
visible below the fullscreened surface.

After requesting that the surface should be unfullscreened, the

Whether this actually removes the fullscreen state of the client is
subject to compositor policies.

Making a surface unfullscreen sets states for the surface based on the following:
* the state(s) it may have had before becoming fullscreen
* any state(s) decided by the compositor
* any state(s) requested by the client while the surface was fullscreen

The compositor may include the previous window geometry dimensions in
the configure event, if applicable.

implement for example menus, popovers, tooltips and other similar user
interface concepts.

A popup can be made to take an explicit grab. See xdg_popup.grab for
details.

When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at
the same time the surface will be unmapped. See the xdg_popup.popup_done
event for details.

Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup and
unmap the surface. Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another
surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
request.

A newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created
xdg_popup surfaces associated with the same xdg_toplevel.

The parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface
description) before the xdg_popup itself.

The x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify
where the top left of the popup should be placed, relative to the
local surface coordinates of the parent surface. See
xdg_surface.get_popup. An xdg_popup must intersect with or be at least
partially adjacent to its parent surface.

The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
for the xdg_popup state to take effect.

grab will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup, or when the
client destroys the xdg_popup. This can be done by the user clicking
outside the surface, using the keyboard, or even locking the screen
through closing the lid or a timeout.

If the compositor denies the grab, the popup will be immediately
dismissed.

This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a
button press, key press, or touch down event. The serial number of the
event should be passed as &#x27;serial&#x27;.

The parent of a grabbing popup must either be an xdg_toplevel surface or
another xdg_popup with an explicit grab. If the parent is another
xdg_popup it means that the popups are nested, with this popup now being
the topmost popup.

Nested popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created
in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times is the
topmost one.

When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they may dismiss every
nested grabbing popup as well. When a compositor dismisses popups, it
will follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.

The parent of a grabbing popup must either be another xdg_popup with an
active explicit grab, or an xdg_popup or xdg_toplevel, if there are no
explicit grabs already taken.

If the topmost grabbing popup is destroyed, the grab will be returned to
the parent of the popup, if that parent previously had an explicit grab.

If the parent is a grabbing popup which has already been dismissed, this
popup will be immediately dismissed. If the parent is a popup that did
not take an explicit grab, an error will be raised.

During a popup grab, the client owning the grab will receive pointer
and touch events for all their surfaces as normal (similar to an
&quot;owner-events&quot; grab in X11 parlance), while the top most grabbing popup
will always have keyboard focus.
