        <div class="f6 lh-copy ws-pre-line courier">This interface allows a compositor to announce support for server-side
decorations.

A window decoration is a set of window controls as deemed appropriate by
the party managing them, such as user interface components used to move,
resize and change a window&#x27;s state.

A client can use this protocol to request being decorated by a supporting
compositor.

If compositor and client do not negotiate the use of a server-side
decoration using this protocol, clients continue to self-decorate as they
see fit.

Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the &#x27;z&#x27; prefix and the
version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
interface version number is reset.

that the client prefers the provided decoration mode.

After requesting a decoration mode, the compositor will respond by
emitting a xdg_surface.configure event. The client should then update
its content, drawing it without decorations if the received mode is
server-side decorations. The client must also acknowledge the configure
when committing the new content (see xdg_surface.ack_configure).

The compositor can decide not to use the client&#x27;s mode and enforce a
different mode instead.

Clients whose decoration mode depend on the xdg_toplevel state may send
a set_mode request in response to a xdg_surface.configure event and wait
for the next xdg_surface.configure event to prevent unwanted state.
Such clients are responsible for preventing configure loops and must
make sure not to send multiple successive set_mode requests with the
same decoration mode.
