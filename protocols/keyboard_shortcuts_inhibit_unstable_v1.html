        <div class="f6 lh-copy ws-pre-line courier">A keyboard shortcuts inhibitor instructs the compositor to ignore
its own keyboard shortcuts when the associated surface has keyboard
focus. As a result, when the surface has keyboard focus on the given
seat, it will receive all key events originating from the specified
seat, even those which would normally be caught by the compositor for
its own shortcuts.

The Wayland compositor is however under no obligation to disable
all of its shortcuts, and may keep some special key combo for its own
use, including but not limited to one allowing the user to forcibly
restore normal keyboard events routing in the case of an unwilling
client. The compositor may also use the same key combo to reactivate
an existing shortcut inhibitor that was previously deactivated on
user request.

When the compositor restores its own keyboard shortcuts, an
&quot;inactive&quot; event is emitted to notify the client that the keyboard
shortcuts inhibitor is not effectively active for the surface and
seat any more, and the client should not expect to receive all
keyboard events.

When the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor is inactive, the client has
no way to forcibly reactivate the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor.

The user can chose to re-enable a previously deactivated keyboard
shortcuts inhibitor using any mechanism the compositor may offer,
in which case the compositor will send an &quot;active&quot; event to notify
the client.

If the surface is destroyed, unmapped, or loses the seat&#x27;s keyboard
focus, the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor becomes irrelevant and the
compositor will restore its own keyboard shortcuts but no &quot;inactive&quot;
event is emitted in this case.
