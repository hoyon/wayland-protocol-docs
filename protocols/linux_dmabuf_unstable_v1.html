        <div class="f6 lh-copy ws-pre-line courier">Following the interfaces from:
https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.khronos.org&#x2f;registry&#x2f;egl&#x2f;extensions&#x2f;EXT&#x2f;EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import.txt
https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.khronos.org&#x2f;registry&#x2f;EGL&#x2f;extensions&#x2f;EXT&#x2f;EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import_modifiers.txt
and the Linux DRM sub-system&#x27;s AddFb2 ioctl.

This interface offers ways to create generic dmabuf-based
wl_buffers. Immediately after a client binds to this interface,
the set of supported formats and format modifiers is sent with
&#x27;format&#x27; and &#x27;modifier&#x27; events.

The following are required from clients:

- Clients must ensure that either all data in the dma-buf is
  coherent for all subsequent read access or that coherency is
  correctly handled by the underlying kernel-side dma-buf
  implementation.

- Don&#x27;t make any more attachments after sending the buffer to the
  compositor. Making more attachments later increases the risk of
  the compositor not being able to use (re-import) an existing
  dmabuf-based wl_buffer.

The underlying graphics stack must ensure the following:

- The dmabuf file descriptors relayed to the server will stay valid
  for the whole lifetime of the wl_buffer. This means the server may
  at any time use those fds to import the dmabuf into any kernel
  sub-system that might accept it.

To create a wl_buffer from one or more dmabufs, a client creates a
zwp_linux_dmabuf_params_v1 object with a zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1.create_params
request. All planes required by the intended format are added with
the &#x27;add&#x27; request. Finally, a &#x27;create&#x27; or &#x27;create_immed&#x27; request is
issued, which has the following outcome depending on the import success.

The &#x27;create&#x27; request,
- on success, triggers a &#x27;created&#x27; event which provides the final
  wl_buffer to the client.
- on failure, triggers a &#x27;failed&#x27; event to convey that the server
  cannot use the dmabufs received from the client.

For the &#x27;create_immed&#x27; request,
- on success, the server immediately imports the added dmabufs to
  create a wl_buffer. No event is sent from the server in this case.
- on failure, the server can choose to either:
  - terminate the client by raising a fatal error.
  - mark the wl_buffer as failed, and send a &#x27;failed&#x27; event to the
    client. If the client uses a failed wl_buffer as an argument to any
    request, the behaviour is compositor implementation-defined.

Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the &#x27;z&#x27; prefix and the
version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
interface version number is reset.

The 64-bit unsigned value combined from modifier_hi and modifier_lo

This is an opaque token. Drivers use this token to express tiling,
compression, etc. driver-specific modifications to the base format
defined by the DRM fourcc code.

Warning: It should be an error if the format&#x2f;modifier pair was not
advertised with the modifier event. This is not enforced yet because
some implementations always accept DRM_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID. Also
version 2 of this protocol does not have the modifier event.

This request raises the PLANE_IDX error if plane_idx is too large.
The error PLANE_SET is raised if attempting to set a plane that

            <div class="f6 lh-copy ws-pre-line courier">This asks for creation of a wl_buffer from the added dmabuf
buffers. The wl_buffer is not created immediately but returned via
the &#x27;created&#x27; event if the dmabuf sharing succeeds. The sharing
may fail at runtime for reasons a client cannot predict, in
which case the &#x27;failed&#x27; event is triggered.

The &#x27;format&#x27; argument is a DRM_FORMAT code, as defined by the
libdrm&#x27;s drm_fourcc.h. The Linux kernel&#x27;s DRM sub-system is the
authoritative source on how the format codes should work.

The &#x27;flags&#x27; is a bitfield of the flags defined in enum &quot;flags&quot;.
&#x27;y_invert&#x27; means the that the image needs to be y-flipped.

Flag &#x27;interlaced&#x27; means that the frame in the buffer is not
progressive as usual, but interlaced. An interlaced buffer as
supported here must always contain both top and bottom fields.
The top field always begins on the first pixel row. The temporal
ordering between the two fields is top field first, unless
&#x27;bottom_first&#x27; is specified. It is undefined whether &#x27;bottom_first&#x27;
is ignored if &#x27;interlaced&#x27; is not set.

This protocol does not convey any information about field rate,
duration, or timing, other than the relative ordering between the
two fields in one buffer. A compositor may have to estimate the
intended field rate from the incoming buffer rate. It is undefined
whether the time of receiving wl_surface.commit with a new buffer
attached, applying the wl_surface state, wl_surface.frame callback
trigger, presentation, or any other point in the compositor cycle
is used to measure the frame or field times. There is no support
for detecting missed or late frames&#x2f;fields&#x2f;buffers either, and
there is no support whatsoever for cooperating with interlaced
compositor output.

The composited image quality resulting from the use of interlaced
buffers is explicitly undefined. A compositor may use elaborate
hardware features or software to deinterlace and create progressive
output frames from a sequence of interlaced input buffers, or it
may produce substandard image quality. However, compositors that
cannot guarantee reasonable image quality in all cases are recommended
to just reject all interlaced buffers.

Any argument errors, including non-positive width or height,
mismatch between the number of planes and the format, bad
format, bad offset or stride, may be indicated by fatal protocol
errors: INCOMPLETE, INVALID_FORMAT, INVALID_DIMENSIONS,
OUT_OF_BOUNDS.

Dmabuf import errors in the server that are not obvious client
bugs are returned via the &#x27;failed&#x27; event as non-fatal. This
allows attempting dmabuf sharing and falling back in the client
if it fails.

This request can be sent only once in the object&#x27;s lifetime, after
which the only legal request is destroy. This object should be
destroyed after issuing a &#x27;create&#x27; request. Attempting to use this
object after issuing &#x27;create&#x27; raises ALREADY_USED protocol error.

It is not mandatory to issue &#x27;create&#x27;. If a client wants to
cancel the buffer creation, it can just destroy this object.

In case of import success, no event is sent from the server, and the
wl_buffer is ready to be used by the client.

Upon import failure, either of the following may happen, as seen fit
by the implementation:
- the client is terminated with one of the following fatal protocol
  errors:
  - INCOMPLETE, INVALID_FORMAT, INVALID_DIMENSIONS, OUT_OF_BOUNDS,
    in case of argument errors such as mismatch between the number
    of planes and the format, bad format, non-positive width or
    height, or bad offset or stride.
  - INVALID_WL_BUFFER, in case the cause for failure is unknown or
    plaform specific.
- the server creates an invalid wl_buffer, marks it as failed and
  sends a &#x27;failed&#x27; event to the client. The result of using this
  invalid wl_buffer as an argument in any request by the client is
  defined by the compositor implementation.

This takes the same arguments as a &#x27;create&#x27; request, and obeys the
same restrictions.
